trying to fix reward, points on each face are not in the same order. Theyre in the order they were placed
they ARE grouped by face
i can find center point in the we reward function
  jk no i cant, it might be better to do it in the init/placing

make sure bellman eq is implemented properly
  bellman was not implemented at all
  started working on it, got a shape error that indicates the state memory isnt being popped properly
  it runs for the first 12 timesteps because it breaks with a condition
  i could "trim" it every time but that feels wrong
