trying to fix reward, points on each face are not in the same order. Theyre in the order they were placed
they ARE grouped by face
i can find center point in the we reward function
  jk no i cant, it might be better to do it in the init/placing

next is to verify training works as expected
then change model to RNN

make wins folder to record wins during long runs
